# Sand Simulation & Tetris Integration
This project demonstrates a sand simulation using grid structure and cellular automata in Unity. The simulation allows sand particles to fall and interact based on simple rules. Later, I integrated this system with Tetris mechanics to create an interesting combination of both concepts.

Features:
Cellular Automata-based Sand Simulation: Using grid-based logic, sand particles fall and settle, creating realistic sand behavior.
Tetris Integration: The sand simulation was combined with Tetris gameplay mechanics, where falling blocks interact with the sand.
